abstract = {This program allows you to collect data from Ocean Insight spectrometers and other brands. One can change the basic controls of the spectrometer, like the integration time and the number of measurements. Additionally, you can remove background spectra with the "Dark measurement" option and do absorption measurements with the "Bright measurement" button. Furthermore, one can add a large amount of relevant metadata for future automated analysis.},
